# 👋 Hi, I’m @Johnulinkng you can call me Hans
- 👀 I’m interested in ... solving real-world problems with code, whether it's through mathematics, cryptography, or building secure data systems. Also, finding the perfect balance between coffee consumption and productivity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... the intricacies of blockchain, decentralized platforms, and how to convince my cat to contribute to my GitHub projects (progress: minimal).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... software development projects that need a blend of math, computer science, and a sprinkle of humor. Whether it's developing secure applications or building the next big thing in fintech, count me in!
- 📫 How to reach me ... just send a message in a bottle, or the old-fashioned way via email: hlin85@jh.edu.
- 😄 Pronouns: ... He, but if you bring coffee, you can call me anything.
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I once tried to write code using only emojis. Spoiler alert: it did not end well. On a more serious note, I speak English, Japanese, Mandarin, and Cantonese, which comes in handy when I need to apologize in multiple languages for breaking the build. And, did you know? I love basketball, Ping-Pong, and traveling around the world – all while contemplating deep learning algorithms!
